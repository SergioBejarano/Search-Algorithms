def ternary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Performs a ternary search on a sorted array to find the target element.
    The array is divided into three parts in each iteration.

    Args:
        arr (list): The sorted list of elements to search.
        target: The element to find in the array.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target element if found, otherwise -1.

    Time Complexity: O(logâ‚ƒ n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
